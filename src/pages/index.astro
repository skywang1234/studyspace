    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
Study Space began as a summer project aimed at providing UNC students with a way to learn and connect. 
As incoming UNC students ourselves, we wanted to design a service that would make the transition to college fun and easy. 
Our goal is to alleviate some of the awkwardness that new classes and a new environment bring!
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you want to keep up with classes, meet new people, or cram for finals, 
        we hope that you use Study Space to grow at light-speed.
