# ðŸŒŒ Study Space
Study Space began as a summer project aimed at providing UNC students with a way to learn and connect. 
As incoming UNC students ourselves, we wanted to design a service that would make the transition to college fun and easy. 
Our goal is to alleviate some of the awkwardness that new classes and a new environment bring!
